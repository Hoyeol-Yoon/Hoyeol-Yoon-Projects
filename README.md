# Julia Projects
These projects were submitted as assignments for Professor Jim Luedtke's "Advanced Optimization Modeling" course in the 24-Spring semester at UW-Madison. 

The assignments cover a variety of optimization problems, including TSP, Knapsack, and Scheduling.

The main focus is on solving these problems using Julia, particularly by varying the modeling formulations to compare solving times.
